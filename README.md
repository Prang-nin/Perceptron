# About this project
This code is part of my assignment project.
- The objective of this project is to create the perceptron for binary classification and apply one-vs-rest algorithms for multiple classification.
- Train and test data set are stored seperately.
- The evaluation report for each classicification can be generated using built-in function.
- More information about the program and how to use the program can be found in README.txt
